Splendor
====================================

Splendor is an OpenAPI compatible Python web API framework built on top of `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_.

We focus on :ref:`Collections` as a primary construct, tying together data, permissions, and business 
logic in an elegant way that can be immediately imported into tools like Swagger.

We emphasize :ref:`Organic Development` of APIs by scaffolding the process from quick *iteration* to 
solid, well tested, documented, and importantly, *maintainable* versions.
